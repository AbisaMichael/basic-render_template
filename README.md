# This is a simple Python script that uses the Flask web framework to create a basic web application with two routes.

The first route ("/") corresponds to the home page of the web application, which returns the rendered template "home.html" using the Flask's render_template() function.

The second route ("/second") corresponds to a second page of the web application, which returns a string "this is my second page".

Finally, the script starts the Flask web server by calling the run() method on the Flask application object app, with the debug option set to True.

When this script is executed, it starts a local web server listening on port 5000 by default. You can access the home page of the web application by navigating to http://localhost:5000 in your web browser. The second page can be accessed by navigating to http://localhost:5000/second.
